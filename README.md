</p>

Installation
---
The most preferable way to use this library is cocoapods. Add the following line to your `Podfile`:
```sh
pod 'SRCountdownTimer'
```
and run `pod install` in your terminal.

Alternatively, you can manually add the files in the `SRCountdownTimer` directory to your project.

Usage
--
Create a custom instance of SRCountdownTimer(subclass of UIView) using the storyboard or directly in the code.

You can customize different properties:
```swift
public var lineWidth: CGFloat = 2.0
public var lineColor: UIColor = .black
public var trailLineColor: UIColor = UIColor.lightGray.withAlphaComponent(0.5)

public var isLabelHidden: Bool = false
public var labelFont: UIFont?
public var labelTextColor: UIColor?
public var timerFinishingText: String?
```
The last(timerFinishingText) means the text that will be shown after timer expires. If nil - it'll show the current counter value(0).

Use this method to start the countdown:
```swift
public func start(beginingValue: Int, interval: TimeInterval = 1)
```

To pause:
```swift
public func pause()
```

To resume(will start from the current state of view)
```swift
public func resume()
```
